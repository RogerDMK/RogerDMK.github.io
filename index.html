                    During my electrical engineering degree I learned how to design electronic circuits and control systems.
                    I am proficient in signal processing and filtering and have an understanding of the underlying mathematical representation.
                    This is due to my strong understanding of linear algebra, specifically within the Fourier space.
                    The development of these skills have given me a unique training and experience in problem solving and critical thinking, even in situations where the practical skills from engineering are not relevant my problem solving and critical thinking remain to be relevant.

                        competition focused on setting up a functional cluster and optimizing 
                        benchmarks. This was a fun and informative time, where I gained hands on experience at running benchmarks on a cluster that I setup. This competition also allowed me to talk to and learn the day to day of a cluster administrator.</p>

                        <p>
                            I am currently competing in the NASA suits UI design competition with the RISD team! The competition challenges students to design the UI for a spacesuit and rover to be used in space.
                            The UI needs to show realtime locations, maps of any points of interest, and system details all in an AR environment.
                            The rover needs to be controllable from the suit and should be able to autonomously drive by itself and constantly communicate with the spacesuit.

                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Sport</div>
                    Throughout my school career I enjoyed partaking in different sports teams, playing on my school's squash, tennis, basketball, and soccer teams. I found these as fun experiences where I could work within the team and build stronger friendships among my classmates.
                    I am proud to add that my high school career culminated in winning both my school's squash and basketball league division and taking part in my province's basketball team in the SACSA easter tournament. Nowadays I find these activities as great recreational moments to reconnect with friends and classmates!

                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Music</div>
                    I spent my youth learning the piano for 12 years, achieving a UNISA 5th grade level. This is a wonderful creative outlet that I continue to use today. I find music is a calming activity that allows one's mind to forget about any current stresses or worries, allowing me to refocus my thoughts and feelings.
